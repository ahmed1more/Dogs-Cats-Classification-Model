## Project Motivation

The goal of this project is to:

- Develop a robust CNN model for binary image classification tasks.
- Make AI accessible through a user-friendly web interface.
- Provide insights into deep learning model training and deployment.

This project is ideal for those interested in exploring computer vision applications and deployment workflows.

## Features

- **Accurate Classification**: Classifies images as either "Dog" or "Cat" with high accuracy.
- **Interactive Web App**: Upload images and view classification results in real-time.
- **Pre-Trained Weights**: Utilizes transfer learning to speed up training and improve performance.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle multiple images and datasets with ease.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed.
- **Pip**: Package installer for Python.
- **Git**: Version control system.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed1more/Dogs-Cats-Classification-Model.git
   cd Dogs-Cats-Classification-Model
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run Web-App.py
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Launch the Streamlit application.
2. Upload an image of a dog or cat through the web interface.
3. View the classification result displayed on the screen.

---

## Dataset

The model is trained on the popular **Dogs vs. Cats dataset** available on Kaggle. The dataset contains labeled images of dogs and cats, split into training and validation sets. For your convenience, you can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

## Model Architecture

The CNN used in this project includes:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input images.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while retaining essential features.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform final classification.
4. **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting.

Transfer learning techniques (e.g., pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet) may also be employed.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Images are resized to a uniform dimension.
   - Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve generalization.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A CNN model is trained using the processed dataset.
   - The loss function (e.g., Binary Crossentropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam) are used for optimization.

3. **Prediction**:
   - User-uploaded images are passed through the model.
   - The model outputs probabilities, which are converted to class labels (Dog or Cat).

4. **Web Interface**:
   - Streamlit renders the front-end, allowing users to interact with the model seamlessly.
